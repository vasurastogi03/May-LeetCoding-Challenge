1)
This solution makes use of the fact that all square numbers are sum of odd numbers starting from 1.
For ex :
1 = 1
1+3 = 4
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
.... and so on
So we keep subtracting odd numbers from the given number, starting from 1. If the number eventually reaches 0, it is a perfect square. If it reaches a negative number without reaching 0 it is not a perfect square.
